to make it work
do:
idf.py menuconfig 
and then 
XPT2046
and make sure
"Convert touch coordinates to screen coordinates"
is DISABLED/OFF

press s to save
and then try again!!!


next up if the color looks weird change lvgl configuration
and enable/disable swap color bytes



if u cant find it perhaps im skitzophrenic and it works without that option just try it
